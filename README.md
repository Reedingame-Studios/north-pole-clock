What time is it in the North Pole?

The North Pole clock was an idea that I had actually from a book by New Scientist's magazine entitled "Why Don't Penguin's feet freeze?" - this was one of the main
questions posed by that book.  At the North Pole, there are 6 months of darkness and 6 months of daylight.  So, what if we figured out how long an hour was,
relatively speaking to the day/night cycle?  With a bit of math, we can figure that out!
